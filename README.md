# ft_services

This is a System Administration and Networking project. It introduces you to cluster management and deployment with Kubernetes.

Technical considerations
Must use Kubernetes
Set up a multi-service cluster that includes Nginx, Wordpress, PhpMyAdmin, MySQL, Grafana, InfluxDB and FTPS
Each service runs in a dedicated container
Containers are built using Alpine Linux
Dockerfile of each service needs to be custom built. Forbidden to use docker images from DockerHub
